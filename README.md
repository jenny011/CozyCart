# CozyCart

## A Chrome browser extension for quick food search.
Have you ever felt exhausted comparing prices on online grocery stores? Have you ever opened up multiple tabs just to find an available item? CozyCart removes all the trouble for you, offering you a one-stop option with the sorted purchase links you want for your recipe ingredients!

### Description
When you prepare for cooking and viewing a recipe online, you can simply select one ingredient and click the CozyCart icon, which will direct you to a new tab presenting the most relevant items from Amazon Fresh and other sources sorted by availability, price, and rating. 

### Future developments
So far, we have only implemented a prototype. The next step will be to incorporate searching and sorting. If possible, our future development would be making this tab view into a floating window that can allow you to stay on the same page while looking for different items.
